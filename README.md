# PixelRanch

  Pixel Ranch is a 2D top-down resource management game which contains farming elements, from buying plots of land to plant more crops to 
more space for animals. You have to take care of the animals to collect their produce and sell it so you can survive the next wave of bills 
that seem to get bigger and bigger each 3 days.
